# Antd Addons

`antd-addons` is a collection of React Components based off of the [Ant
Design Framework](https://ant.design/), and is tailored toward the rapid
prototyping of React applications using GraphQL as a backend.

It provides several helpers, from an error indicator to a complex React
component that allows searching for a specific model from your backend
and selecting it in a UI.
